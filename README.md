# rock-paper-scissor-frontend
This project is a simple and interactive Rock–Paper–Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer generates a random choice. Based on the selected options, the game displays the result (Win/Lose/Draw) and updates the score.
